            <h2>Working at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging - The Price Lab</h2>
            <h3>Written on 05/02/2025</h3>
            <p>
                The <a href="https://www.buckinstitute.org/">Buck Institute</a> is a non-profit research organization that focuses on finding
                cures for age-related diseases. I grew up five minutes from the Buck and therefore have been aware of their impact 
                through teachers, employees, and even a high school field trip! This admiration inspired me to look for opportunities to get involved
                during my gap year inbetween my bachelor's and master's. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Since Februrary of this year, I have been interning at Nathan Price's lab. I was instantly drawn to his work, 
                which supports a shift from "treating sickness" to "increasing healthspans". In other words, what if we could detect
                physiological abnormalities before symptoms are present? This would likely enable research for new treatments for degenerative 
                diseases like Alzheimer's which are currently incurable. Big data, artificial intelligence, and connectivity make this initiative possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently contributing to a Retrieval Augemented Generation (RAG) model that provides n of 1 care (personalized recommendations
                for an individual patient). By building APIs that retrieve electronic health records and silos of biological data, we can increase
                AI's capabilities and improve the accuracy of preventative health insights.  </p>
