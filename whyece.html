            <h1>Why, and How, I Pursued a Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)</h1>
            <h2>Shifting from a bioinformatics focus.</h2>
            <p class="post-date">May 5, 2025</p>
            <h3>Why I am writing this</h3>
            <p>
                Forgive me, but I believe that engineering culture can often be pessimistic. However, I am not targeting my opinion towards any specific experience or professional colleague. I think that this sentiment is ignited by engineering being considered one of the hardest majors due to the math and science required. Labeling it as such ultimately leads to the reasoning that it is exclusive, not for everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
                By the time I started UCSD, many people in the community adhered to a "pecking order". It was implied certain subdisciplines are more prestigious than others. In other words, they could do my job, but I would never be able to do theirs. If you allow me to be more specific, I have been told that I am not cut out for electrical engineering, simply because of my bioinformatics degree. However, there are countless examples of electrical engineering students turning to lucrative software engineering roles once they enter industry. Ironically,
                <a href="https://be.ucsd.edu/sites/default/files/uploads/UG%20Flowcharts/BINF%20flowchart%20Rev.%202-4-2025.pdf">my degree</a>
                required at least nine computer science courses.
                <a href="https://ece.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/undergraduate-programs/electrical-engineering-major">
                    Electrical engineering</a> requires zero.
              
            </p>
            <p>
                I am writing this because trying something new is scary, especially when others have their fair share of doubts. 
                Yet I am still deserving to contribute, learn, and succeed in ECE. 
            </p>

            <h3>Why Did I Decide To Pursue a Master's?</h3>
            <p>
                Leading into my final year of my bachelor's, I was verbally extended a full-time software engineering role. This was at a company I had 
                previously interned at, and I was excited to return, as the first job after college is seen as the hardest to land.
                I graduated in the spring of 2024, a year and a half after Open AI was publicly released and changed the tech industry forever. By this time, 
                the company no longer had the budget to hire another new grad, and I realized that I would have to fight tooth and nail for another job.             
            </p>
            <p>
                I applied to graduate school in the fall of 2024 as a backup plan in case I had trouble landing a role. At this point, I was incredibly disappointed and thought of all the small things I could have done differently. But this period allowed me to reflect in a way I hadn't before. I realized I was grieving the loss of a stable career path, not necessarily a missed passion. I had detoured from my original interest which motivated me to study bioinformatics; building tools to evaluate mental disorders. One degree later, I saw the problem at hand entirely differently. AI can find patterns in biosystems, but it is dependent on the medical devices available. I began envisioning a future where I revolutionized our current interpretation of biosignals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before any graduate schools notified me of their decision, I was offered a role as an automation engineer. It was a great opportunity, but I knew another path had the potential to be more fulfilling. I sacraficed the safety of a full-time position and hoped that a university would give me the opportunity to follow my dreams.
            </p>
            <h3>What Were My Results?</h3>

            </p>
            <h3>Steps I Took</h3>
            <p>
                <ol> 
                    <li>As mentioned in the first section of this post, I was skeptical that many schools would seriously consider non-ECE undergraduates. Therefore, I only applied to schools that highlighted their interest in interdisciplinary research. Additionally, in my essays, I prioritized the following:
                    <ol>
                        <li>mentioning ECE PIs that were also in the bioengineering deparment</li> 
                        <li>mentioning interest in classes that these PIs taught</li>
                        <li>explaining how I could uniquely contribute because of my experience</li>
                        <li>explaining examples of when I learned new information outside of my degree</li>
                        <li>explaining experiences which introduced me to hardware</li>
                        <li>detailing how I would be using my gap year to contribute to research</li>
                        <li>expressing interest in participating in outreach programs</li>
                        <li>detailing what I would do after the master's</li>
                        <li>stressed that my education complimented ECE</li>
                    </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I cold emailed several professors. In general, this should be done before submitting your application, but better late than never! From my experience, I usually get a positive response one out of four times (ultimately a number's game). Regardless of whether they respond, knowing that you put the effort in can impact how they review your application. If they agree to a coffee chat, I highly recommend you be your (best) self. Know how to talk about your experience and why you want to do it. Be honest about what you don't know and show interest in exploring it. Share outside interests and how they influence your work. Ultimately, what they think of you is representative of their own biases. If you value the same things, then this can be a great way to connect. If they don't, then you are better off thriving somewhere else.
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                             From my experience, I get the best responses with short emails. Lab websites can be outdated and it helps me avoid talking into a niche they aren't interested in anymore.   
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <li>
                        I took my first circuits class ever! I was able to take it at a community college to save money, and it was a
                        great way to know what I was getting myself into before committing to a master's.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I reached out to local opportunities to get experience. As a result, I ended up volunteering at UC San Francisco. The lab focused on using deep learning to interpret the brain and attending lab meetings helped me become acquainted with hot topics like autoencoders and transformers. Additionally, I helped with the preprocessing pipeline for EEG data. This was a great middle step between machine learning and hardware.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I reached out to my letters of recommendation three months in advance. I asked them what materials they would need. 
                        I sent a physical thank you note after they submitted their letter.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I took the GRE. This was a waste of time because the only school that needed it was UCSD, and my application was 
                        never reviewed.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            </p> -->
            <h3>Advice for Others</h3>
            <p>
                I think the biggest piece of advice I can give is to only apply to schools that excite you.
                While I picked a graduate degree over a job, there are plenty of opportunities to get experience in the workforce.
                Master's can be a great opportunity, but they are also expensive and time consuming. Therefore only do it if checks off 
                all your boxes.
            </p>
            <h3>Limitations</h3>
            <p>
                I am very fortunate to have multiple acceptances, despite being a non-traditional applicant. However, I probably could have 
                a couple more options if I had been more patient with myself. Acceptances in top tier programs are competitive, and my GPA,
                missing ECE classes, and little experience probably eliminated me off the bat. Had I taken an extra quarter at UCSD to 
                ace elective ECE classes, I would have been in a better position. Additionally, networking is half of the battle, and I could
                have made an extra effort to connect with professors at highly ranked schools.
            </p>
            <h3>Notes</h3>
            <p>
                I mentioned needing nine CSE courses to complete my degree. However, if you look at the website linked, you will count six. 
                This is because BENG 181, 182, and 183 are cross-listed as CSE 181, 182, and 183. All students shared the same section, homework,
                tests, teachers, etc.

            </p>
            <p>
                I submitted my application to UCSD, my alma mater, one month before the deadline. However, a week after the application was due, I was
                informed that they never recieved payment. Therefore my application was never reviewed.
