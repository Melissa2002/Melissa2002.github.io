         <p> Hello! My name is Melissa, and I am completing my degree in bioinformatics 
            in the Spring of this year (2024) from the University of California, San Diego. 
            This major gave me deep understanding of how computer science can be used to 
            explain and analyze datasets too large otherwise to make sense of. When exploring 
            technology in class, labs, and industry, I began to realize how little I truly 
            began to understand that I did not ask enough questions about the commodities associated
             with living in California. I used technology everyday without questioning the painstaking 
             work it must have taken the inventions behind the product. 
             My true passion is asking "why?", exploring the unknown, and using this understanding to
             create what once seemed impossible.  </p>
